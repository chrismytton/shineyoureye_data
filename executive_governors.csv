Consequently, Ngilari won a re-election into the House of Representatives before he was picked to serve as Nyako’s running mate. Nyako won the election and Ngilari became the deputy governor of Adamawa state . In 2004 however, he was allegedly reported to have resigned in order to avoid being impeached along with Nyako. Right after Nyako was impeached, the speaker of the House of Assembly, Fintiri was sworn-in as Governor. 

Mr. Ngilari, whose office was declared vacant on July 15, 2014 by the state’s lawmakers after he purportedly resigned, later challenged the legality of his resignation and filed a suit before the Federal High Court in Abuja, seeking an order compelling his swearing in as the governor of the state. 

Conclusively, the High Court later ruled that Ngilari's resignation process was not in line with the Nigerian constitution as he didn't address his resignation letter to the governor as the constitution states. Hence, Fintiri's emergence as governor of Adamawa state was declared illegal, while Ngilari was sworn-in to continue Nyako's tenure.
