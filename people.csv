534,Male,1953-12-00,"","",Bala James Ngilari,"Bala James Ngilari was elected to represent Michika/Madagali/South/Maiha Federal Constituency in 2003. prior to this time, he was a legal practitioner, a member of the Constitutional Conference between 1994 and 1995, and a member of the Human Right Violation Investigation Committee (Oputa Panel).

Consequently, Ngilari won a re-election into the House of Representatives before he was picked to serve as Nyako’s running mate. Nyako won the election and Ngilari became the deputy governor of Adamawa state . In 2004 however, he was allegedly reported to have resigned in order to avoid being impeached along with Nyako. Right after Nyako was impeached, the speaker of the House of Assembly, Fintiri was sworn-in as Governor. 

Mr. Ngilari, whose office was declared vacant on July 15, 2014 by the state’s lawmakers after he purportedly resigned, later challenged the legality of his resignation and filed a suit before the Federal High Court in Abuja, seeking an order compelling his swearing in as the governor of the state. 

Conclusively, the High Court later ruled that Ngilari's resignation process was not in line with the Nigerian constitution as he didn't address his resignation letter to the governor as the constitution states. Hence, Fintiri's emergence as governor of Adamawa state was declared illegal, while Ngilari was sworn-in to continue Nyako's tenure.

In August 2001 he was appointed head of a delegation from the Arewa Consultative Forum to meet and discuss common goals with Northern state governors and other leaders.

In 2003, he was Deputy National Chairman North for the All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP). In November 2004, he was locked in an internal ANPP struggle with Chief Donald Etiebet, the National Chairman.

In May 2006, he left the ANPP to become chairman of a new party, the Democratic People's Party, taking with him other members of the progressive wing of the ANPP. However, he was suspended indefinitely in December 2008 for saying the death of Ken Saro-Wiwa was a national sacrifice.

He was succeeded by Biodun Ogunbiyi, who criticized Useni's poor leadership, resulting in failure to win any seats in the Senate or House of Representatives in the April 2007 elections. Useni ran for election as Senator for Plateau South in April 2011 on the DPP platform, but was defeated by Victor Lar of the PDP.

4 years later, he ran on the PDP platform and was elected senator for Plateau South
